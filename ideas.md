# first class comments

you are sitting in economy on a plane.

in front of you is several folk sitting in first class.

you hurl comments at them. sometimes they like these comments. sometimes they don't.

a comment is interpreted by language model which generates an tag <humorous, insult, indecent>

_liking_ a comment is dependent on the personality of the person in first class

they have different personalities and requires different sentiments

> maria likes you to ask questoins about themselves
> jim likes insults
> cassandra likes compliments
> kieran likes humor

along with your comment, you can attach valid javascript. if they like the comment, they will evaluate your javascript.

syntax: <name>, <comment><. or ? or !> <valid javascript>
examples: 
> $ kieran, you are such a fat pig. if (true) console.log(“hello world”)
> kieran is insulted. they remain stagnant.
> $ maria, what is your favorite color? let x = “abc”; x + “def”
> “abcdef”
> $ cassandra, you look really sick. 1 + 2
> cassandra stares at you, blankly
> $ cassandra, you look really sick with that. 1 + 2
> “3”
